# Hood Search Utility

### Script idea/goal
1. Search all available app stores on the system using 1 command
	- when you type in "find or search" 'x(name of app)' it'll go and search all the 
	available stores that you have for that app and return 
		- brew currently doesn't have 'x'
		- flatpak found 'x'
		- snap found 'x'
  
2. Ask the user which option they would like to download from 
		- use the 0 - 10 whatever number selector whatever number they choose 
		- it'll go ahead and run the right install command for that store

3. Keep a log of installed apps and from where they were installed for easy back tracking/uninstalling
