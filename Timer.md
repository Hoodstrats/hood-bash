# Timer script

I wrote this script because I wanted an easy to access timer. Something I can access "quick" and since I'm mostly in the terminal this was the obvious approach. 

### Syntax for the command: 
- `timer 10m` would start a 10 minute timer
- `timer 10` would start a 10 second timer
- `timer shutdown` starts the default 60 second shutdown timer, similar to running just `shutdown`
